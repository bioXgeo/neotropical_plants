# Code & Workflow
This repository contains R code and the accompanying workflow for compiling occurrence and trait data for plants and frugivores (mammals and birds exhibiting frugivory), cleaning and subsetting data, and calculating the taxonomic and functional diversity of plants and frugivores.
More details are available at [/code/readme.md](https://github.com/bioXgeo/neotropical_plants/blob/master/code/readme.md)
