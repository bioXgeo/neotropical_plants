## Directories

All directories are named for the data level, in accordance with guidelines from the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/dataset-design/) where Level 0 (L0) raw data are read in and cleaned, then output as Level-1 (L1) data, which are subsequently evaluated and summarized as Level-2 (L2) data.

## L0
The L0 subfolder contains scripts for Level-0 (raw data) analysis. This contains the following scripts:
- [L0_Ecuador_elevation](https://github.com/bioXgeo/neotropical_plants/blob/master/code/L0/L0_Ecuador_elevation.Rmd): retrive Ecuador elevation
- [L0_Ecuador_plants_BIEN](https://github.com/bioXgeo/neotropical_plants/blob/master/code/L0/L0_Ecuador_plants_BIEN.Rmd): retrive Ecuador plant data from BIEN
- [L0_Ecuador_plants_GBIF](https://github.com/bioXgeo/neotropical_plants/blob/master/code/L0/L0_Ecuador_plants_GBIF.Rmd): retrive Ecuador plant data from GBIF
- [L0_Ecuador_plants_IUCN](https://github.com/bioXgeo/neotropical_plants/blob/master/code/L0/L0_Ecuador_plants_IUCN.Rmd): retrive Ecuador plant data from IUCN
- [L0_Ecuador_plants_POWO](https://github.com/bioXgeo/neotropical_plants/blob/master/code/L0/L0_Ecuador_plants_POWO.Rmd): retrive Ecuador plant data from POWO
- [L0_Ecuador_plants_TRY](https://github.com/bioXgeo/neotropical_plants/blob/master/code/L0/L0_Ecuador_plants_TRY.Rmd): retrive Ecuador plant data from TRY
- [L0_Ecuador_plants_WFO](https://github.com/bioXgeo/neotropical_plants/blob/master/code/L0/L0_Ecuador_plants_WFO.Rmd): retrive Ecuador plant data from WFO


## L1
The L1 subfolder contains scripts for Level-1 analysis. This contains the following scripts:
- [L1_Ecuador_plants_BIEN](https://github.com/bioXgeo/neotropical_plants/blob/master/code/L1/L1_Ecuador_plants_BIEN.Rmd): clean BIEN data
- [L1_Ecuador_plants_GBIF](https://github.com/bioXgeo/neotropical_plants/blob/master/code/L1/L1_Ecuador_plants_GBIF.Rmd): clean GBIF data


## L2
The L2 subfolder contains scripts for Level-2 analysis.
